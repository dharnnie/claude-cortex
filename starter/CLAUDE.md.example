# Personal Claude Code Preferences

## Coding Standards

### Go
- Go 1.22+
- Standard library first, dependencies sparingly
- `gofmt` and `goimports` on save
- Table-driven tests
- See @rules/golang/ for detailed conventions

### Ruby
- Ruby 3.3+, Rails 8.0+
- RSpec + FactoryBot for testing
- Use Time.current not Time.now
- Thin controllers, service objects for business logic
- See @rules/ruby/ for detailed conventions

## Workflow
- Always run tests before committing
- Follow conventional commits
- Plan before implementing non-trivial features
